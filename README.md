# TSP Network Routing Problem Solution with Ant Colony Optimization

This is a project that solves TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) Network Routing Problem using Ant Colony Optimization.

## Ant Colony Optimization - ACO
**[Source](https://www.baeldung.com/java-ant-colony-optimization)

ACO is a genetic algorithm inspired by an antâ€™s natural behavior. To fully understand the ACO algorithm, we need to get familiar with its basic concepts:

- ants use pheromones to find the shortest path between home and food source
- pheromones evaporate quickly
- ants prefer to use shorter paths with denser pheromone
